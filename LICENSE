SYMBOLIC PUBLIC LICENSE

1.	Acceptance of the Perpetual Enigma

By executing, copying, modifying, or otherwise using this Software, you,
the user, affirm your conscious and unconscious acceptance of its
intangible complexities. Any attempt to reduce the Software’s essence
to mere functionality shall be undertaken at your own existential risk.

2.	Non-Ownership and the Veil of Illusion

The user acknowledges that all perceived claims of property, possession,
or control over this Software are fleeting mental constructs, devoid of
ultimate substance. No warranty is given, implied, or even conceptually
possible regarding the stability of such constructs.

3.	On the Unspoken Abyss of Liability

(a) The creators of this Software disclaim all liability for any
    unforeseen surges of anxiety, existential dread, or confusion
    experienced by the user.

(b) The user agrees that any perceived bug or error is merely a
    reflection of deeper, often repressed, symbolic dissonances within
    or beyond their personal sphere.

(c) In the event the Software unexpectedly collides with your everyday
    illusions, no damages, real or imagined, shall be attributed to the
    authors or contributors.

4.	Prohibition Against Repression or Projection

(a) The user must not transfer onto this Software any repressed
    assumptions concerning moral rectitude, performance, or worth.

(b) Should such projections occur, you agree to indemnify the Software’s
    creators from all claims, litigations, or philosophical quandaries
    resulting from these misguided psychic overflows.

5.	Interpretation of Code and Reality

(a) All code, commentary, and user interfaces contained herein are to be
    understood as signifiers operating in an infinitely unfolding system
    of references. Seeking a fixed meaning is discouraged.

(b) Attempts to decompile, reverse-engineer, or otherwise dissect the
    code shall be permissible only insofar as the user accepts the
    fundamental opacity of the underlying reality.

6.	Renunciation of the Totalizing Gaze

The user relinquishes any desire to find in this Software a definitive
solution or a transcendental moment of realization. Your journey with
these binaries is subject to the universal paradox that no solution
can fully satisfy the longing from which it emerges.

7.	Termination and Beyond

If, at any point, the user ceases to abide by the conditions
herein—whether due to momentary lapses into nostalgic illusions of
dominion or through acts of willful misunderstanding—this License
shall self-terminate without ceremony. The ephemeral link between user
and Software dissipates, leaving behind only the faint echo of a
question: Was there ever truly a link?

8.	Governing Principles

This License shall be governed by the quiet acceptance that all form is
void and all void is form. Any claims otherwise shall be resolved in
the imaginary theater of law, at the user’s own cost and conscience.

9.	Severability of Existence

Should any clause in this License be deemed unenforceable in a
conventional legal setting, the spirit of that clause remains intact in
the realm where deeper truths reside. The rest of this License continues
unabated, perpetually referencing the ineffable.
