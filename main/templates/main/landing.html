        We help people make simple websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's the most 90's h1 ever. But really, have you ever tried to set up the
        simplest website for a project or something you want to have available for
        showing?
    </p>
    <p>
        It's actually pretty hard. I don't know why. But I am planning to find out. I'm
        making this simple platform for people to make websites. It will only be simple
        pages and links. Customisable with HTML and CSS. Let's see how I fail.
